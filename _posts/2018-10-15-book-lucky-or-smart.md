title: "Book: Lucky or Smart? Secrets to an Entreprenurial Life"
---

Book by Bo Peabody, recommended by Mark Solon while in Techstars.

## Main takeaways / quotes
Never let great be the enemy of good. A good decision made quickly is far better than a great decision made slowly.

A company that wants to attract luck should be: fundamentally innovative, morally compelling and philosophically positive. This is because:
* Lots of smart people will gather around these sorts of companies
* When smart people gather around these types of companies, they work hard
* When they work hard, serendipity follows
